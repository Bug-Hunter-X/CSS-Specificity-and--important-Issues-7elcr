The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected styling behavior when styles from multiple selectors conflict. For example, if an inline style is overridden by an embedded style and then again by an external stylesheet, the external stylesheet will take precedence because of the higher specificity of its selector.  Understanding how specificity works is crucial for troubleshooting these issues.  Another common issue is the use of !important which can break the normal CSS cascade, making it more difficult to maintain and debug.  Excessive use of !important should be avoided.
